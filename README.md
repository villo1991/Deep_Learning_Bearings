Bearing Fault Diagnosis: Predictive Maintenance Project
  Technical Portfolio | Personal Research & Development

Project Overview
  This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for fault detection in rolling element bearings. 
  Using high-frequency vibration and current signals, this project aims to classify structural health 
  conditions using Machine Learning and Signal Processing techniques.
  This project was developed for personal research and professional portfolio development to demonstrate 
  expertise in industrial IoT (IIoT) and predictive maintenance.
